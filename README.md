## For further information, chech Wiki segment.

 An Artificial Intelligence (AI) requires a lot of data to process and a good flow 
through systems to analysis it respect to created models. The project which is 
completed during internship, aims to create a services to store data and able to 
flow it with APIs. Using modern tools to create a system where data is controlled, 
processed and updated is the biggest point of this project. Being able to manage 
data through system with APIs and process them with specific functions that runs 
remotely is servicing to these conditions. Creating a system requires good flow 
between different technologies which is improving the problem solving 
mechanism to deal with any possible appeared problems. In the end a beautiful 
system that allows multiple purpose across the different APIs has been created.
